First three weeks ….

We started the first few weeks with an introduction to some languages like Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript 
and many libraries for Python, such as pandas,numpy, and matplotlib, for plotting graphs using the data files, etc.
Those were very interesting to do. After that, we were given one week to complete the assignments and complete the incomplete work.

	
Now comes the final project,

The problem statement is to write a code, that automatically stores the specified content in the  website.

We imported libraries like requests, selenium,beautifulsoup4, 	

We used this link <“https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?groups=top_100&sort=user_rating,desc"> for getting top movies in imdb website

Our goal is to store the data of the top 25 movies such as names, 
Duration, rating, director, etc 

Using requests, we sent a request to the IMDb website and then using beautiful soup and html5lib, we parsed the HTML code 
By using XPath and CSS selectors, we stored the links of the top 25 movies in a list and  a movie_url JSON file

Now we have a list of URLs  by running a loop over the list accessing every movie URL, and then collecting the data, through Xpath

And appending them to the .json file
